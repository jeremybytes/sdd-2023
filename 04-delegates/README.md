# Get Func-y: Delegates in C#  
*Coding Level: 4*  
*Advanced Level: 2*  

Delegates are the gateway to functional programming. So lets understand delegates and how we can change the way we program by using functions as parameters, variables, and properties. In addition, we’ll see how the built in delegate types, Func and Action, are waiting to make our lives easier. We’ll see how delegates can add elegance, extensibility, and safety to our programming.
