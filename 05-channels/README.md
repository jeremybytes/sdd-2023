# Better Parallel Code with C# Channels  
*Coding Level: 4*  
*Advanced Level: 3*  

Producer/consumer problems show up in a lot of programming scenarios, including data processing and machine learning. Channels give us a thread-safe way to communicate between producers and consumers, and we can run them all concurrently. In this presentation, we will explore channels by comparing parallel tasks with continuations to using a producer/consumer model. In the end, weâ€™ll have another tool in our toolbox to help us with concurrent programming. Attendees will need to have some familiarity with C# (six months or so), experience using Task and continuations would be helpful but is not required.
