# Get Comfortable with .NET 7 and the CLI  
*Coding Level: 4*  
*Advanced Level: 2*  

Command-line interfaces (CLI) can be very powerful. The same is true in the .NET world. So let’s get comfortable with creating, running, and testing applications using the command-line interface. We’ll create a self-hosted web service and then write an application to use that service. Unit tests will make sure things work along the way. Whether you’re new to .NET 7 or have been using .NET 7 with Visual Studio, this session will help you get up-to-speed in this powerful environment. Attendees will need to be familiar with C#.
