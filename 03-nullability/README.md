# Safer Code: Nullability and Null Operators in C#  
*Coding Level: 4*  
*Advanced Level: 2*  

New projects in C# have nullable reference types enabled by default. This helps make the intent of our code more clear, and we can catch potential null references before they happen. But things can get confusing, particularly when migrating existing projects. Today we will look at the safeguards that nullability provides as well as the problems we still need to watch out for ourselves. In addition, we will learn about the various null operators in C# (including null conditional, null coalescing, and null forgiving operators). These can make our code more expressive and safe. Attendees will need some familiarity with C# (at least six months or so).
